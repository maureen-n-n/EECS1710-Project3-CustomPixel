# EECS1710-Project3-CustomPixel

This project breaks down the pixels of a picture and creates many dots which interact with
the user's cursor. To see the original picture and generate pixels, the user must click on their mouse.
The dots which are made from the pixels of the original picture will avoid the mouse's cursor.
